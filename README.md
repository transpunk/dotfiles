# dotfiles
a very purple theme for hyprland

NOTE: this might be hard to use for ppl who can't see well, if u want you can disablle opacity (or enable blurring, whichever one works better for u)

i might make an installer script in the future? but for now this is it.

### config files included:

menu: fuzzel

terminal: kitty

wm: hyprland

lockscreen: hyprlock

sysfetch: fastfetch

i also have my keybindings file here but they're just a sample

### to add:

status bar: waybar (gotta clean up the config first teehee

plus maybe vscodium settings.json but idk

about wallpapers: i have a couple of my fave wallpapers here, i recommend skull.jpg or city.jpg for this theme, but no wallpaper app configs. also i have no idea where they came from so sorry :c
