# dotfiles
a very purple theme for hyprland

NOTE: this might be hard to use for ppl who can't see well, if u want you can disablle opacity (or enable blurring, whichever one works more)

i might make an installer script in the future? but for now this is it.

### config files included:

status bar: waybar (the config is a mess, but it works)

menu: fuzzel

terminal: kitty

wm: hyprland

lockscreen: hyprlock

audio visualizer: cava (v simple config lmao)

sysfetch: fastfetch

plus vscodium json settings because why not

i also have my keybindings file here but they're just a sample
